            <p class="left">Astrology has been Margarita’s passion for as long as she can remember. Even as a child, she
                            instinctively knew people’s Star signs—sometimes recalling those before their names. Linda
                            Goodman, the iconic astrology writer of the 60s, became her early doorway into the mystical
                            world of the stars. Margarita spent her younger years absorbed in Goodman’s work, feeling a
                            profound resonance with the way astrology seemed to explain parts of herself she had no
                            other language for.</p>
                        <p class="left">In her twenties, (circa 2010) she began studying Vedic (Eastern) Astrology under the guidance
                            of her uncle and discovered yoga at the same time. Her hunger for deeper study eventually
                            led her to enrol in a three-year Diploma with Rod Suskin’s School of Astrology. Awarded a
                            scholarship for her final year, she graduated with distinction and soon after left her
                            full-time job—right on her Saturn Return at age 29 in 2015—to pursue astrology
                            professionally.</p>
                        <p class="left">After building experience abroad through workshops and consultations within conscious
                            communities, she returned to Cape Town and began teaching her own 12-week astrology
                            foundations course. She expanded into a range of offerings, including Astrology and Tarot
                            workshops on various topics. Tarot became an essential complement to her work, balancing
                            astrology’s rational structure with intuitive insight.</p>
                        <p class="left">As Margarita explored different branches of astrology—natal, predictive,
                            relationship-focused, and horary—she increasingly gravitated toward a psychological
                            approach. Though not a mainstream, psychologist, she discovered a natural ability to reveal
                            clients’ complexes, shadows, and gifts. Many described her sessions as being “just like a
                            really good therapy session”. Her work focuses on illuminating unresolved patterns,
                            identifying past influences, and helping clients see what has been unconscious or
                            overlooked.</p>
                        <p class="left">Her psychological approach deepened through extensive studies in Jungian work. Over the years
                            she completed a year-long certification in Jungian psychology, the “12 Steps to
                            Individuation” program, and the Conscious Living Program, along with various
                            embodiment-based trainings. Earlier, between 2016 and 2018, she also completed two formative
                            courses: Yoga & Psychotherapy, and an in-depth Jungian study series. These experiences
                            profoundly shaped her method, giving her a broader map of the psyche and allowing her to
                            translate Jungian concepts into astrological language. She now works closely with archetypal
                            symbolism—the ten planets as expressions of inner complexes, active energies, and
                            unconscious dynamics.</p>
                        <p class="left">In recent years, Margarita has become increasingly sought after for her expertise in
                            relationship astrology. From writing on compatibility to consulting couples seeking deeper
                            understanding, this field has become one of her greatest passions—an ongoing devotion to
                            helping people relate with more awareness, compassion, and clarity.</p>
                        <p class="left">Margarita is regularly called upon to teach at festivals, retreats and workshops and has also
                            made appearances in local publications, TV & radio. </p>
